INFO:NetListWriters:633 - The generated Verilog netlist contains Xilinx SIMPRIM
   simulation primitives and has to be used with SIMPRIM simulation library for
   correct compilation and simulation. 
INFO:NetListWriters - Setup Simulation - To perform a setup simulation, specify
   values in the Maximum (MAX) field with the following command line modifier: 
   -SDFMAX
INFO:NetListWriters - Hold Simulation - To perform the most accurate hold
   simulation, specify values in the Minimum (MIN) field with the following
   command line modifier:  -SDFMIN
INFO:NetListWriters:665 - For more information on how to pass the SDF switches
   to the simulator, see your Simulator tool documentation.
